# Smoker classification using XGBoost classifier

The data used for this notebook is from the UK Smoking Habits Survey. This dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/smoking-dataset-from-uk). We first analyze the data through visualization and then try to predict whether a person is a smoker or a non-smoker using XGBoost classifier.
